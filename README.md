# osm-diversity

Smaller projects to help make OSM more diverse.

## What is this repo even for?

This repository is for collaborating on concrete tools that will help us communicate around diversity issues and make OSM more diverse (see below).

What we don't want here is higher-level conversations around diversity issues. Not because they're bad conversations, but because they're not necessarily conversations about building or fixing a tool.

Discussion about what tools we build, why we build them, why we shouldn't build them, or why they are bad, should all be kept on the [list serve](http://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/diversity-talk). 

If you have a specific concern around diversity in OSM or want to talk about diversity issues in OSM, please join the [diversity-talk](http://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/diversity-talk) list and let us know! We need your voice in this.  

## Collaborating

We'd love to hear your feedback - OSM needs your voice. 

If you want to be added as a collaborator in this project - which means you want to  write code - please add you github handle to [this ticket]().

If you find a bug or notice specific language in a project that is not as inclusive as it should be, please open a ticket in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-diversity/issues).

If you have a higher level issue with what we're doing here or want to propose a project, contact the [list serve](http://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/diversity-talk). 


## Projects 

Here's a short list of a few projects that seem actionable and focused. These are just ideas, but actionable ones. 

If you have concrete ideas for a project, open a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-diversity/issues).

### diversity-statement

Inspired by [welcome-osm](http://osmlab.github.io/welcome-osm/), this could be a mid-jump, one-page website to communicate publicly that OSM cares about diversity issues and introduce to new mappers they can engage or rais their own diversity-related concerns. I would love to have a site we could link-drop to organizations like [Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/) as an introduction to diversity issues in OSM. While this site could stand on it's own, ideally it would eventually be incorporated into the main openstreetmap.org site.

### OSM Diversity Report

Basically [Alyssa's slides](http://vimeopro.com/openstreetmapus/state-of-the-map-us-2013/video/68098504) from State of the Map US 2013, in the style of the [2013 OSM data report](http://www.mapbox.com/osm-data-report/). While this could be incorporated into (parts of it probably definitely should be), doing a yearly report to measure our own progress would be a really good benchmark. Besides, for the 2014 report we can already include that we have a new listserve and repository!

### OSM Anti-harrasment Policy

Let's write a Anti-harrasment policy for all OSM conferences, mapping parties, and gatherings. Probably more of a reasearching task into existing policies that other organizations have found effective. This should also eventually be incorporated into the osm.org site.
